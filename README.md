# Land-Team
A repository for sharing resources related to autonomous vehicles.

So firstly, the bit that stops people from claiming anyone "stole" their work;

Content added to this repository should be added with your name included in each file you add.
By adding files to this repository, you agree that other contributers to this repository may use your file(s), either in part or in full, as long as a reference is given, stating you are the original creator of the file.

All works when created, at least within UK law, are automatically protected by copyright protection under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. For more information, please visit https://www.gov.uk/copyright

To keep this repository simple and friendly, please do the following:

. Put your name in files you upload.

. Include the names of others who, in part, helped create files. (If help was given)

. Reference any work that isn't your own.

Now the bit that protects authors;

No guarantee or warranty is offered by the author(s) of any files. No liability is accepted by any author(s). All rights go to respective authors.
